TCP minet project

We completed the core of the tcp_module file. We were able to successfully establish a three-way handshake and perform communications after as well. We were able to use netcat to communicate with our Minet stack and see the appropriate stages occuring in the TCP module. We were able to transmit both text and files using netcat. We also performed tests using tcp_client and tcp_server in both user and kernel mode. When running the server in kernel mode outside of Minet we had to access the server via the domain name labeled on the computer as opposed to through one of the IP addresses we were assigned. The same is true for when we ran our tests with the http_client and http_server binaries.
